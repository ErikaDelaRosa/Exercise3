/*A Lifetime Supply... Create a function to calculate how much you’ll actually be getting for a lifetime supply of your 
favorite snack. The function should accept two arguments: age and amount per day. The function should calculate the 
amount that "will" be consumed for the rest of your life given a constant max age. Bonus Accept floating point values for 
amount per day and round the result.
i.e. calcSupply(25, 2) ➞ “You will need 40,150 bars of chocolate (2 a day) to last you til the age of 80.”*/ 

//1. This is the most flexible option - so i can add the numbers in here
function chocoLife (age,amount) {  // from here the calculation 
    let maxAge = 100 - age; // a variable to find out how many years are still happening
    console.log(maxAge); //i check the result, just in case
    let annualChoco = amount * 365; // here we know how much chocolate we need in one year
    let suply = maxAge * annualChoco; // this is the final calculation 
    console.log(`You will need ${suply} chocolates for a life suply`);
    }
    chocoLife(20,4); // here i can set the amount of years and pieces per day, and re-use the formula
