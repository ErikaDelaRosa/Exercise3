/*Find 3 exercises that you have did in 3 ways, or do 3 exercises in 3 ways if you haven’t did that yet.
Create 3 repository’s (each exercise get one repo).
Add 3 branches in every repo (each branch has a different solution).
Upload 3 photos (one photo to each branch) to your README.md showing your code and the console part,

/*A Lifetime Supply... Create a function to calculate how much you’ll actually be getting for a lifetime supply of your 
favorite snack. The function should accept two arguments: age and amount per day. The function should calculate the 
amount that "will" be consumed for the rest of your life given a constant max age. Bonus Accept floating point values for 
amount per day and round the result.
i.e. calcSupply(25, 2) ➞ “You will need 40,150 bars of chocolate (2 a day) to last you til the age of 80.”*/ 

//3  i am using constants on this example 
const after8Annual = 2 *365; // how many after8 per day and then in one year 
console.log(after8Annual); // here i check the total annual amount
const remainingTime = 100 - 20; // lets guess how many year will still live the subject 
console.log(remainingTime); // check result
const lifeAfter8 =  after8Annual * remainingTime; // calculation of the total with all the processed info
console.log(`You will need a suply of ${lifeAfter8} after eight for a lifetime suply`)
