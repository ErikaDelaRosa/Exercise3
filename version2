Create 3 repository’s (each exercise get one repo).
Add 3 branches in every repo (each branch has a different solution).
Upload 3 photos (one photo to each branch) to your README.md showing your code and the console part,

/*A Lifetime Supply... Create a function to calculate how much you’ll actually be getting for a lifetime supply of your 
favorite snack. The function should accept two arguments: age and amount per day. The function should calculate the 
amount that "will" be consumed for the rest of your life given a constant max age. Bonus Accept floating point values for 
amount per day and round the result.
i.e. calcSupply(25, 2) ➞ “You will need 40,150 bars of chocolate (2 a day) to last you til the age of 80.”*/

const lifeKit= kitkatLife.maximumAge - kitkatLife.age ; // i use dot to access the info saved above
console.log(lifeKit); // another check
const kitSuply = lifeKit * kitkatLife.kit * kitkatLife.year; // final calculation
